# Hacker New clone
This is a Hacker News clone written in Javascript with Navigo.

It shows you all the same tabs as Hacker News:
- Top
- New
- Ask
- Show

And it also implements favouriting functionality where users can view their favourited stories.

## How to run
To have a look, you can use any HTTP server. For example, install `http-server`:

```bash
npm install -g http-server
```

Clone the code and `cd` into the repo.

Run `http-server` and go to localhost:8080. Enjoy!
